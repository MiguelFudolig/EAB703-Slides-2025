# Views of Probability

## Objective Probability

Probability was thought of by statisticians and mathematicians only as an objective phenomenon derived from objective processes.

::: callout-note
There are two categories of objective probability:

-   classical/a priori probability

-   frequentist/a posteriori probability
:::

## Classical Probability

Probabilities for random events related to games of chance can be calculated by the processes of abstract reasoning. Therefore, it is not necessary for these events to happen to compute these probabilities.

::: {.callout-note title="Classical/A Priori Probability"}
Probability is defined as follows: If an event can occur in $N$ mutually exclusive and equally likely ways, and if $m$ of these possess a trait $E$, the probability of the occurrence of $E$ is equal to $m/N$.

$$
P(E)= m/N
$$
:::

::: callout-note
As an example, the probability of getting a three after tossing a **fair** six-sided die can be calculated by assuming that each of the six sides is equally likely to be observed.

The number of outcomes that include a three is 1 out of a total of 6 mutually exclusive outcomes.

Hence, the probability is 1/6.
:::

## Frequentist Probability

The frequentist approach to probability depends on the repeatability of some process and the ability to count the number of repetitions, as well as the number of times that some event of interest occurs. The probability describes the long-run relative frequency of occurrences from the process.

::: {.callout-note title="Frequentist/A Posteriori Probability"}
Probability is defined as follows: If some process is repeated a large number of times, $n$, and if some resulting event with the characteristic $E$ occurs $m$ times, the relative frequency of occurrence of $E$, $m/n$, will be *approximately equal* to the probability of $E$.

$$
P(E) = m/n
$$
:::

::: callout-important
Note that $m/n$ is only an estimate of the probability, and that $n$ should be large to have a better estimate of $P(E)$.

Example: [Monty-Hall Problem](https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/montyhall/Monty.html)
:::

## Subjective Probability

This view holds that probability measures the confidence that a particular individual has in the truth of a particular proposition.

::: callout-note
The most famous example of subjective probability is *Bayesian*, which is a mathematically formal method to combine experimental data and expert information in producing probabilities.
:::

# Properties of Probability

## Helpful Definitions

::: {.callout-note title="Sample Space"}
A sample space is a list of all possible outcomes that might be observed.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Event"}
An event is any collection of outcomes in the sample space.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Mutually Exclusive"}
If two events $E_i$ and $E_j$ contain no elements in common, these two events are said to be disjoint or mutually exclusive.
:::

## Axioms of Probability

The properties of probability was mathematically formalized by Russian mathematician A.N. Kolgomorov by defining the following axioms:

1.  For each event $E_i$, the probability of $E_i$ is non-negative.
2.  The sum of the probabilities of the mutually exclusive events is equal to 1.
3.  Consider any two mutually exclusive events, $E_i$ and $E_j$. The probability of occurrence of either $E_i$ or $E_j$ is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities.

## Calculating Marginal Probabilities

We can calculate the probability of occurrence for events using the sample point method.

::: {.callout-note title="Sample Point Method"}
Under the assumption that every outcome in the sample space is equally likely to occur, the probability that some event $E_i$ occurs is defined as the number of outcomes corresponding to $E_i$ divided by the total number of outcomes in the sample space.

In frequency distributions, this corresponds to the relative frequency of a specific outcome.
:::

::: callout-important
Probabilities computed using this method are often referred to as **marginal probability**. Marginal probabilities are unconditional and are specific to an event.
:::

## Example

Out of 1,325 university students, 532 of them reported to consume caffeine through coffee. What is the marginal probability of selecting a university student who consumes coffee?

$$
P(E) = \frac{532}{1325}
$$

The resulting probability is `r round(532/1325,3)`.

## Example 2

Consider the `AMSSurvey` data in the package `carData`. The data set includes the counts of new PhDs in the mathematical sciences for 2008-09 and 2011-12 categorized by type of institution, gender, and US citizenship status. You can learn more about the data set by typing `?carData::AMSsurvey` after installing the `car` package.

::: panel-tabset
### Question + Data

What is the probability of selecting a participant of the survey at random who is not a US citizen in 2008? Use the `count` variable.

```{r}
library(carData)
AMSsurvey
```

### Answer

The total counts can be calculated using the `sum` function. Or simple addition.

```{r}
sum(AMSsurvey$count)
```

We can also count the total number of non-US citizens in the data set.

```{r}
130+29+79+25+89+50+53+39+122+105+28+12
```

Thus, the probability can be calculated as `r 130+29+79+25+89+50+53+39+122+105+28+12`/ `r sum(AMSsurvey$count)` = `r round((130+29+79+25+89+50+53+39+122+105+28+12)/ sum(AMSsurvey$count),3)`

## Exercise

The "COVID-19 Effects on the Mental and Physical Health of Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders Survey Study II" (COMPASS II) data set is from a follow-up survey implemented from 12/2021 to 05/2022. The data set is composed of responses from 3,411 participants. [@do2025]

::: panel-tabset
### Exercise

The table below shows the breakdown of the census region reported by the participants. What is the probability that a randomly selected participant was from the Northeast census region?

| Census Region | Frequency |
|---------------|-----------|
| Midwest       | 289       |
| Northeast     | 344       |
| South         | 472       |
| West          | 2,303     |

### Answer

The marginal probability is 344/3411 = `r round(344/3411,3)`
:::

## Union of Events

Union means "together": the union of events $A$ and $B$ consists of all outcomes that are either in event A, event B, or both.

::: callout-note
The union of events is mathematically denoted by $\cup$ or "OR". 

As an example, consider Event A: drawing an ace from a standard deck of cards and Event B: drawing a diamond from a standard deck of cards. The union of events A and B can be interpreted as "the event where we draw an ace or a diamond card" or in mathematical terms $Ace \cup Diamond$.
:::

## Intersection of Events

The intersection of events $A$ and $B$ consists of all outcomes that are in event A **AND** event B.

::: callout-note
The intersection of events is mathematically denoted by $\cap$ or "AND". 

As an example, consider Event A: drawing an ace from a standard deck of cards and Event B: drawing a diamond from a standard deck of cards. The intersection of events A and B can be interpreted as "the event where we draw an ace AND a diamond card" or in mathematical terms $Ace \cap Diamond$. This simplifies to drawing of a specific card: the ace of diamonds.
:::

## Union vs. Intersection

![Or vs. And](figs/3-venn.png)

## Additive Law of Probability

For any two events $A$ and $B$, the probability of $A$ or $B$ occurring is equal to:

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A)+P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

::: callout-important
Disjoint events cannot happen at the same time. For disjoint events $C$ and $D$, $P(C \cap D) = 0$. Therefore, $P(C \cup D) = P(C)+P(D)$ is consistent with Axiom 3.
:::

## Example

What is the probability of rolling a 1 or 3 on a single roll of a fair six-sided die?

::: callout-important
Rolling a 1 and a 3 is not possible. Thus, $P(roll 1 \cap roll 3) = 0$.
:::

$$
P(roll 1 \cup roll 3) = P(roll 1) + P(roll 3) - P (roll 1 \cap roll 3) 
$$
$$
P(roll 1 \cup roll 3) = 1/6+1/6-0 = 1/3 
$$

Thus, $P(roll 1 \cup roll 3)=$ `r round(1/3,4)`

## Example 2

Consider a standard deck of playing cards. What is the probability of drawing an ace or a diamond card?

::: callout-important
Drawing an ace AND a diamond card is possible. This event corresponds to drawing the ace of diamonds. The probability of drawing the ace of diamonds from a standard deck of playing cards is 1/52. Hence,
$P(A \cap D) = 1/52$.
:::

$$
P(A \cup D) = P(A) + P(D) - P (A \cap D) 
$$

$$
P(Ace \cup Diamond) = 4/52 + 13/52 - 1/52 = 16/52 
$$
Thus, $P(Ace \cup Diamond)$ = `r round((13+4-1)/52,4)`

## Exercise

From a sample of 30 adults, nine reported cannabis use, eight reported cigarette use, and two reported both cigarette and cannabis use.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Question
What is the probability that a randomly selected adult from the sample reported cannabis or cigarette use?

### Answer

$P(Cannabis)=9/30$, $P(Cigarette)=8/30$, $P(Cannabis\cap Cigarettes) = 2/30$. Therefore,

$$
P(Cannabis \cup Cigarettes) = P(Can) + P(Cig) - P(Can\cap Cig)
$$

$$
P(Cannabis \cup Cigarettes) = 9/30 + 8/30 - 2/30 = 15/30
$$

$P(Cannabis \cup Cigarettes)$ = `r round((9+8-2)/30,2)`
:::

## Independent Events

Two events are independent if knowing the outcome for one of the events provides no information about the outcome of the other event. Mathematically,

::: {.callout-note title="Independent Events"}
Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$.
:::

## Example

What is the probability of getting two heads from two independent coin tosses?

$$
P(H1 \cap H2) = P(H1)P(H2) = (1/2)(1/2)
$$
$P(H1 \cap H2)$ = `r round(1/4,2)`

## Exercise

According to the [National Down Syndrome Society](https://ndss.org/about), the probability that a 35-year-old woman conceives a child with Down syndrome is approximately 0.28%. 

:::{.panel-tabset}
### Exercise

What is the probability that two independently sampled 35-year-old women will both conceive children with Down syndrome? 

### Answer

$$
P(C1Down \cap C2Down) = P(C1Down)P(C2Down) = (0.0028)(0.0028)
$$
$P(C1Down \cap C2Down)$ = `r format(0.0028^2*100,scientific=F)`%
