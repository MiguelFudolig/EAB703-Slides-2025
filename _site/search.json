Think of errors as a red traffic light: stop and assess for anything wrong in the code (missing parenthesis, adding characters to numbers, non-existent functions, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nEncountering errors in your code is normal even for an experienced coder. Don’t be afraid to review your code if you made an error! This process is called “debuggging”.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen R produces a warning, your code will still be implemented albeit with some caveats.\n\nfor_plotting &lt;- data.frame(x=c(1,2,3,4,5), y=c(2,4,5,NA,1))\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data=for_plotting,aes(x=x,y=y)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot is displayed, but a warning was raised regarding a missing value. Note that the data frame for_plotting has a missing value for y denoted by NA.\n\n\nIf the output text does not start with an error or a warning, it’s just a friendly message from R telling you about the output. These messages are typically seen when loading R packages or data sets from external sources.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)",
