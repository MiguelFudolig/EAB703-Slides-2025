## Example

Consider the sleep health data, `SleepHealthData.csv`.

```{r}
sleep <- read.csv("SleepHealthData.csv")
```

::: panel-tabset
### Question

Test whether gender (variable `gender`) is associated with reported sleep disorders. Use a significance level of 0.01.

### Answer




```{r}
chisqtest <- chisq.test(sleep$gender,sleep$sleep_disorder)
chisqtest
chisqtest$expected
```

All expected values are above 5, which means the chi-squared assumption is valid. The p-value is `r chisqtest$p.value`, the test statistic is `r chisqtest$statistic` with `r chisqtest$parameter` degrees of freedom. At a significance level of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis. We have sufficient evidence to conclude that the gender and occurrence of sleep disorder are not independent.
