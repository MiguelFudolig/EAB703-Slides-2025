Why or why not?

The respective standard deviations of the historical scores for the control and intervention groups are 3.5 and 5.7. \n\na.\tIf 80 participants are recruited, such that 40 participants are assigned to each group, what is the probability that the average score of the control group exceeds that of the intervention group by a value between 6 and 7?

What theorem can we impose so we can impose the normal approximation for the sampling distribution?
