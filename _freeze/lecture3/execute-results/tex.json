Therefore, it is not necessary for these events to happen to compute these probabilities.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Classical/A Priori Probability\"}\nProbability is defined as follows: If an event can occur in $N$ mutually exclusive and equally likely ways, and if $m$ of these possess a trait $E$, the probability of the occurrence of $E$ is equal to $m/N$.\n\n$$\nP(E)= m/N\n$$\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nAs an example, the probability of getting a three after tossing a **fair** six-sided die can be calculated by assuming that each of the six sides is equally likely to be observed.\n\nThe number of outcomes that include a three is 1 out of a total of 6 mutually exclusive outcomes.\n\nHence, the probability is 1/6.\n:::\n\n## Frequentist Probability\n\nThe frequentist approach to probability depends on the repeatability of some process and the ability to count the number of repetitions, as well as the number of times that some event of interest occurs. The probability describes the long-run relative frequency of occurrences from the process.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Frequentist/A Posteriori Probability\"}\nProbability is defined as follows: If some process is repeated a large number of times, $n$, and if some resulting event with the characteristic $E$ occurs $m$ times, the relative frequency of occurrence of $E$, $m/n$, will be *approximately equal* to the probability of $E$.\n\n$$\nP(E) = m/n\n$$\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nNote that $m/n$ is only an estimate of the probability, and that $n$ should be large to have a better estimate of $P(E)$.\n\nExample: [Monty-Hall Problem](https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/montyhall/Monty.html)\n:::\n\n## Subjective Probability\n\nThis view holds that probability measures the confidence that a particular individual has in the truth of a particular proposition.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe most famous example of subjective probability is *Bayesian*, which is a mathematically formal method to combine experimental data and expert information in producing probabilities.\n:::\n\n# Properties of Probability\n\n## Helpful Definitions\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Sample Space\"}\nA sample space is a list of all possible outcomes that might be observed.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Event\"}\nAn event is any collection of outcomes in the sample space.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Mutually Exclusive\"}\nIf two events $E_i$ and $E_j$ contain no elements in common, these two events are said to be disjoint or mutually exclusive.\n:::\n\n## Axioms of Probability\n\nThe properties of probability was mathematically formalized by Russian mathematician A.N. Kolgomorov by defining the following axioms:\n\n1.  For each event $E_i$, the probability of $E_i$ is non-negative.\n2.  The sum of the probabilities of the mutually exclusive events is equal to 1.\n3.  Consider any two mutually exclusive events, $E_i$ and $E_j$. The probability of occurrence of either $E_i$ or $E_j$ is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities.\n\n# Calculating Probabilities\n\n## Calculating Marginal Probabilities\n\nWe can calculate the probability of occurrence for events using the sample point method.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Sample Point Method\"}\nUnder the assumption that every outcome in the sample space is equally likely to occur, the probability that some event $E_i$ occurs is defined as the number of outcomes corresponding to $E_i$ divided by the total number of outcomes in the sample space.\n\nIn frequency distributions, this corresponds to the relative frequency of a specific outcome.\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nProbabilities computed using this method are often referred to as **marginal probability**. Marginal probabilities are unconditional and are specific to an event.\n:::\n\n## Example\n\nOut of 1,325 university students, 532 of them reported to consume caffeine through coffee. What is the marginal probability of selecting a university student who consumes coffee?\n\n$$\nP(E) = \\frac{532}{1325}\n$$\n\nThe resulting probability is 0.402.\n\n## Example 2\n\nConsider the `AMSSurvey` data in the package `carData`. The data set includes the counts of new PhDs in the mathematical sciences for 2008-09 and 2011-12 categorized by type of institution, gender, and US citizenship status.

The union of events A and B can be interpreted as \"the event where we draw an ace or a diamond card\" or in mathematical terms $Ace \\cup Diamond$.\n:::\n\n## Intersection of Events\n\nThe intersection of events $A$ and $B$ consists of all outcomes that are in event A **AND** event B.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe intersection of events is mathematically denoted by $\\cap$ or \"AND\".\n\nAs an example, consider Event A: drawing an ace from a standard deck of cards and Event B: drawing a diamond from a standard deck of cards. The intersection of events A and B can be interpreted as \"the event where we draw an ace AND a diamond card\" or in mathematical terms $Ace \\cap Diamond$. This simplifies to drawing of a specific card: the ace of diamonds.\n:::\n\n## Union vs. Intersection\n\n![Or vs. And](figs/3-venn.png)\n\n## Additive Law of Probability\n\nFor any two events $A$ and $B$, the probability of $A$ or $B$ occurring is equal to:\n\n$$\nP(A \\cup B) = P(A)+P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\n$$\n\n::: callout-important\nDisjoint events cannot happen at the same time. For disjoint events $C$ and $D$, $P(C \\cap D) = 0$. Therefore, $P(C \\cup D) = P(C)+P(D)$ is consistent with Axiom 3.\n:::\n\n## Example\n\nWhat is the probability of rolling a 1 or 3 on a single roll of a fair six-sided die?\n\n::: callout-important\nRolling a 1 and a 3 is not possible.

What is the probability of drawing an ace or a diamond card?\n\n::: callout-important\nDrawing an ace AND a diamond card is possible. This event corresponds to drawing the ace of diamonds. The probability of drawing the ace of diamonds from a standard deck of playing cards is 1/52. Hence, $P(A \\cap D) = 1/52$.\n:::\n\n$$\nP(A \\cup D) = P(A) + P(D) - P (A \\cap D) \n$$\n\n$$\nP(Ace \\cup Diamond) = 4/52 + 13/52 - 1/52 = 16/52 \n$$ Thus, $P(Ace \\cup Diamond)$ = 0.3077\n\n## Exercise\n\nFrom a sample of 30 adults, nine reported cannabis use, eight reported cigarette use, and two reported both cigarette and cannabis use.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Question\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected adult from the sample reported cannabis or cigarette use?\n\n### Answer\n\n$P(Cannabis)=9/30$, $P(Cigarette)=8/30$, $P(Cannabis\\cap Cigarettes) = 2/30$. Therefore,\n\n$$\nP(Cannabis \\cup Cigarettes) = P(Can) + P(Cig) - P(Can\\cap Cig)\n$$\n\n$$\nP(Cannabis \\cup Cigarettes) = 9/30 + 8/30 - 2/30 = 15/30\n$$\n\n$P(Cannabis \\cup Cigarettes)$ = 0.5\n:::\n\n## Independent Events\n\nTwo events are independent if knowing the outcome for one of the events provides no information about the outcome of the other event. Mathematically,\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Independent Events\"}\nTwo events $A$ and $B$ are independent if $P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$.\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nThe probability $P(A \\cap B)$ is also referred to as the **joint probability** of $A$ and $B$.\n:::\n\n## Example\n\nWhat is the probability of getting two heads from two independent coin tosses?\n\n$$\nP(H1 \\cap H2) = P(H1)P(H2) = (1/2)(1/2)\n$$ $P(H1 \\cap H2)$ = 0.25\n\n## Exercise\n\nAccording to the [National Down Syndrome Society](https://ndss.org/about), the probability that a 35-year-old woman conceives a child with Down syndrome is approximately 0.28%.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Exercise\n\nWhat is the probability that two independently sampled 35-year-old women will both conceive children with Down syndrome?\n\n### Answer\n\n$$\nP(C1Down \\cap C2Down) = P(C1Down)P(C2Down) = (0.0028)(0.0028)\n$$\n\n$P(C1Down \\cap C2Down)$ = 0.000784%\n:::\n\n## Complementary Events\n\nThe **complement** of an event $A$ is defined to be the set of all elements in the sample space that are **NOT** A.\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe complement of $A$ is denoted by $\\bar{A}$ or $A^C$.\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nFor any event $A$ and its complement $A^C$,\n\n$$\nP(A^C) = 1-P(A)\n$$\n:::\n\n## Example\n\nWhat is the probability of *NOT* getting a 1 after rolling a fair six-sided die?\n\n$$\nP([roll 1]^C) = 1 - P(roll 1) = 1-\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}\n$$\n\n## Exercise\n\nIn a survey study, 10.7% reported to have taken undergraduate courses, 23.4% reported to have finished an undergraduate (Bachelor's/Associates) degree, 15.2% reported to have taken postgraduate credits, and 3.9% reported to have finished a graduate degree.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Question\n\nWhat is the probability of randomly sampling a participant who had not received any college-level education?\n\n### Answer\n\nEducational attainment are assumed to be disjoint because respondents cannot be in multiple levels.
