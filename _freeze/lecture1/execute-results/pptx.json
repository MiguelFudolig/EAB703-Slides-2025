Collected data is increasing even at this very moment.\n:::\n\n## Why statistics?\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Statistics\"}\nStatistics is a field of study concerned with:\n\n- The collection, organization, summarization, and analysis of data\n- The drawing of inferences about a body of data when only a part of the data is observed.\n:::\n\nData $\\to$ Numbers $\\to$ Information $\\to$ Investigation $\\to$ Communication\n\n## Statistical Thinking\n\nHow is statistical thinking different from mathematical thinking?\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Statistical Thinking\"}\nStatistical thinking involves understanding and analyzing data while accounting for uncertainty!\n:::\n\n## Activity\n\nFlip a coin 10 times. If you don't have a coin, search \"coin flip\" on Google.\n\n::: callout-note\nHow many times did you get heads? Do you think the coin you flipped was fair?\n:::\n\n## Extensions of Statistics\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n\n### Biostatistics\n\nBiostatistics involves applying statistical concepts to data from the biological sciences, health sciences, and medicine.\n\n### Data Science\n\nData science is the study of how to extract useful information from data using quantitative methods and theories from many fields. The field focuses on large data sets that were not originally designed or collected to address the question of interest.\n\n:::\n\n## Sources of Data\n\nAvailable data usually come from the following sources:\n\n- Records\n- Surveys\n- Experiments\n- Data Banks\n- Prior Literature\n\n## Categories of Statistics\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n\n### Descriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statistics are used to describe properties of complex sets of numbers. Summary statistics are a good example of descriptive statistics.\n\n### Inferential Statistics\n\nInferential statistics are used to infer information from a smaller group (sample) to a more general group (population). \n:::\n\n## Random Variables\n\nRandom variables have values obtained arise as a result of chance factors, so that they cannot be exactly predicted in advance. Values of random variables resulting from measurement procedures are referred to as *observations/measurements*.\n\n::: callout-note\nRandom variables could be classified as qualitative or quantitative.\n:::\n\n## Random Variable Types\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n\n### Quantitative Variables\n\nQuantitative variables are variables that can be measured or characterized with a numerical value.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Discrete Random Variables\"}\nA **discrete variable** is characterized by gaps or interruptions in the values that it can assume. \n\nExample: Customer counts at Cafe Rio, Number of missing teeth, Likert Scale scores\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Continuous Random Variables\"}\nA **continuous variable** is characterized by gaps or interruptions in the values that it can assume.\n\nExample: Speed, Weight, Time\n:::\n\n### Qualitative Variables\n\nQualitative variables cannot be measured numerically, but can be described categorically. Discrete and qualitative variables are also known as *categorical variables*.\n\n\n:::\n\n## Data Types {.scrollable}\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n\n### Nominal Data\n\nAs the name implies, nominal data consist of “naming” observations or classifying them into various mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive categories. \n\nExamples: Assigned sex at birth (male,female); HHS Regions (HHS Regions 1-10)\n\n::: callout-important\nNominal data are typically qualitative in nature and does not account for any ordering in variable levels.\n:::\n\n### Ordinal Data\n\nOrdinal data are for variables with values with inherent ordering.\n\nExamples: Shirt size (Small, Medium, Large, XL); Socioeconomic status (Low, Medium, High)\n\n::: callout-important\nOrdinal data can include discrete variables and some qualitative variables. \n:::\n\n### Interval Data\n\nInterval data includes measurements that can be ordered and a distance metric can be defined between two measurements. Interval scales have equal intervals between values with arbitrary zero points.\n\nExamples: Temperature, IQ\n\n### Ratio Data\n\nRatio data is similar to interval data, but with an absolute zero measurement defined as the \"absence\" of the variable being measured.\n\nExamples: Weight, Height\n:::\n\n## Exercise\n\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n\n### Question \n\nIdentify the type of data/variable for the following:\n\n- BMI\n- Satisfaction Scale (Unsatisfied, Moderately Satisfied, Satisfied, Very Satisfied)\n- Eye Color\n- Credit Rating\n\n### Answers\n\n- BMI (**ratio**)\n- Satisfaction Scale (Unsatisfied, Moderately Satisfied, Satisfied, Very Satisfied) (**ordinal**)\n- Eye Color (**nominal**)\n- Credit Score (**interval**)\n\n:::\n\n\n## Population vs. Sample\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Population\"}\nA population is the largest collection of entities for which we have an interest at a particular time. Measurements of some variable from these entities would generate a population of values for that variable.\n\nAn exact value calculated from a population is referred to as a **parameter**.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Sample\"}\nA sample is a part of the population.\n\nAn exact value calculated from a sample is referred to as a **statistic**.\n:::\n\n## Population vs. Sample {.smaller}\n\n![Taken from: <https://medium.com/@ritusantra/population-v-s-sample-f17c40967257>](figs/1-sample.png){height=5in}\n\n\n## How to Sample\n\nSampling can be grouped into two broad categories: probability-based/random sampling and convenience sampling.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Random Samples\n\nA sample is a random sample when the probability with which every respondent was sampled is known. These probabilities are not necessarily equal. Types of random sampling include:\n\n- Simple random sampling\n- Stratified random sampling\n- Cluster sampling\n\n### Convenience Samples\n\nA sample is a convenience sample when the respondents are selected based on ease of access or availability. This could be a potential source of bias.\n:::\n\n## Scientific Method\n\nThe scientific method is a process by which scientific information is collected, analyzed, and reported in order to produce unbiased and replicable results in an effort to provide an accurate representation of observable phenomena.\n\n![](figs/1-scimethod.jpg){height=3in fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n# Introduction to `R`\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `R` and `RStudio` on your personal computers and laptops by following the instructions on this page: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>\n\n`RStudio` is currently installed on the classroom computers.\n\n## Basic Programming Terminology\n\n- Source Code: A text listing of commands to be compiled or assembled into an executable computer program.\n- Running Code: The act of telling `R` to perform an act by giving it commands through source code.\n- Console Pane: Where `R` commands are entered\n\n::: callout-important\nThere are different types of programming data types such as integers, doubles/numerics, logicals, and characters.\n\n- Integers (int) have values like -1,0,2\n- Numerics (dbl, num) are numbers including integers and decimals,\n- Logicals (logi) are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`\n- Characters (chr)are text variables such as \"Hello, World\", \"Female\", \"Yes\"\n:::\n\n## Basic Programming Terminology\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Vectors\n\nVectors are a series of values. These can be created using the `c()` function, known as the combine/concatenate function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Variables\n\nYou can store different data types to variables using the `<-` sign.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3 4 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Factors\n\nCategorical data are commonly represented in `R` as factors.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 18-39 40-59 60+  \nLevels: 18-39 40-59 60+\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Disagree\"          \"Strongly Disagree\" \"Agree\"            \n[4] \"Neutral\"           \"Strongly Agree\"   \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] Disagree          Strongly Disagree Agree             Neutral          \n[5] Strongly Agree   \nLevels: Strongly Disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly Agree\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Basic Programming Technology {.scrollable}\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Data Frames\n\nData frames are rectangular spreadsheets.

Think of errors as a red traffic light: stop and assess for anything wrong in the code (missing parenthesis, adding characters to numbers, non-existent functions, etc.)\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nEncountering errors in your code is normal even for an experienced coder. Don't be afraid to review your code if you made an error! This process is called \"debuggging\".\n:::\n\n### Warnings\n\nWhen `R` produces a warning, your code will still be implemented albeit with some caveats.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture1_files/figure-pptx/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe plot is displayed, but a warning was raised regarding a missing value. Note that the data frame `for_plotting` has a missing value for `y` denoted by `NA`.\n\n### Messages\n\nIf the output text does not start with an error or a warning, it's just a friendly message from `R` telling you about the output. These messages are typically seen when loading `R` packages or data sets from external sources.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## `R` packages\n\n`R` packages extend the functionality of `R` by providing additional functions, data, and documentation. These packages are written by `R` users around the world and can be downloaded for free!\n\n::: callout-note\nThink of `R` as a new phone. `R` packages are apps that you can download to use your phone in many different ways.\n:::\n\n## Installing and Loading `R` Packages\n\nLike apps on a phone, `R` packages also need to be installed. These packages can be installed by running the following code snippet `install.packages(\"PackageName\")`. For example, to install the package `tidyverse` used for data manipulation and cleaning, you can run the following code:\n\n```{.r}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n\nTo load this package in `R`, you can use the following syntax:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-important\nYou must have an active internet connection to install `R` packages to your device.\n:::\n\n## Exercise\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Exercise\nInstall and load the following packages: `readxl`, `nycflights23` and `knitr`.\n\n### Answer\n\n```{.r}\ninstall.packages(\"readxl\")\ninstall.packages(\"nycflights23\")\ninstall.packages(\"knitr\")\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## Exploring Data Sets {.scrollable}\n\nThe `nycflights23` package includes some data sets saved as data frames.
