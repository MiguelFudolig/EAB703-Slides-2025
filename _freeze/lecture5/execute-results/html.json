Suppose we are interested in calculating the average word length of different samples of 10 words from Beyonce's Crazy in Love.\n\n- Did we get the same average length for all samples?\n\n## Sampling Distributions\n\nRepeated samples will yield different values for the statistics. \n\n::: callout-note\nWe have to view statistics as the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ and sample proportion $\\hat{p}$ as random variables. The probability distribution of these statistics are called sampling distributions. These distributions enable us to:\n\n- Answer probability questions about sample statistics\n- Provide the necessary theory for some statistical inference tests.\n:::\n\n## Sampling Distributions\n\nThe sampling distribution of a statistic is the distribution of *all possible values* that can be assumed by some statistic computed from samples of the same size from the population.\n\n::: callout-note\nWe are usually interested in knowing the functional form (refer to distributions discussed in Chapter 4), mean, and variance.\n:::\n\n\n# Distributions of the Sample Mean\n\n## Sampling from Gaussian-distributed populations\n\nFor a sample with size $n$ that comes from a Gaussian-distributed population with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, i.e. the samples $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ are all independent and identically distributed such that $X_i \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$, the sample mean can be defined as:\n\n$$\n\\bar{X} = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n}{n}\n$$\n\nThe probability distribution of the sample mean, also known as the sampling distribution of the sample mean can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\bar{X} \\sim N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n})\n$$\n\n## Implications\n\n::: callout-important\nThe mean of the sampling distribution, $\\mu_{\\bar{X}}$ is equal to the population mean, while the variance, $\\sigma^2_{\\bar{X}}$ is reduced by a factor of the sample size $n$.\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution can be calculated by taking the square root of the variance of the distribution, $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$. This is referred to as the **standard error** of the sample mean.\n:::\n\n## Standardization\n\nThe sample mean can also be standardized based on the properties of the sampling distribution. The sample mean $\\bar{X}$ can be transformed into a random variable $Z$ such that $Z \\sim N(0,1)$.\n\n$$\nZ = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nIn addition,\n\n$$\nP(\\bar{X} \\leq \\bar{x}) = P(Z \\leq \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}) = P(Z \\leq z)\n$$\n\n\n## Sampling from Non-Gaussian Populations\n\nThe sampling distribution previously derived could also apply to samples from non-Gaussian populations under certain conditions. These conditions are provided by the **central limit theorem**.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\"}\nGiven a population of any non-Gaussian functional form with a mean $\\mu$ and finite variance $\\sigma^2$, the sampling distribution of $\\bar{x}$ computed from samples of size $n$ from this population, will have mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2/n$ and will be approximately Gaussian distributed **when the sample size is large**.\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe rule of thumb for sample means is that a sample size of 30 is satisfactory for the central limit theorem, but this maybe too small for skewed distributions. The Gaussian approximation provided by the CLT becomes better as the sample size increases.\n:::\n\n## Example\n\nSuppose it is known that in a certain large human population cranial length is approximately Gaussian distributed with a mean of 185.6 mm and a standard deviation of 12.7 mm. \n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Question\n\nWhat is the probability that a random sample of size 10 from this population will have a mean greater than 190?\n\n### Answer\nWe can use the sampling distribution because we know the sample is from a Gaussian population. The mean of the sampling distribution, $\\mu_{\\bar{X}}$, should be equal to the population mean. Hence, $\\mu_{\\bar{X}} = 185.6$.\n\nThe standard error, $\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}$, can be calculated using the following formula: $\\sigma_{\\bar{X}} = \\sigma/\\sqrt{n} = 12.7/\\sqrt{10} =$ 4.0161\n\nUsing the knowledge that $\\bar{X} \\sim N(185.6, 12.7/\\sqrt{10})$, we can use `pnorm` to calculate the probability that the sample mean is greater than 190.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npnorm(190,mean=185.6,sd=12.7/sqrt(10),lower.tail=F)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.1366286\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nz <- (190-185.6)/(12.7/sqrt(10))\npnorm(z,0,1,lower.tail=F)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.1366286\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## Example 2\n\nSuppose the hourly number of customer arrivals at a hospital ED has a Poisson distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda=6$. Every hour for 48 hours, the number of customer arrivals is counted and recorded. \n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Question\n\nUse the CLT to approximate the probability that the average number of arrivals is between 5 and 8.\n\n### Answer\n\nThe data is non-Gaussian, but we will assume that the CLT holds. Recall that for a Poisson distribution, the mean is equal to the variance. Specifically, $\\mu=6$, $\\sigma^2 = 6$, $n=48$.
